Although looking polished and professional is an impactful part of it, the prep work, asking good questions, data cleaning and modelling, defining the appropriate metrics, and all the micro decisions that go into why a data point is represented the way it is, are all much more relevant and often overlooked or not even considered. Also, a tool doesn't do successful data viz. It is the skill of the person using the tool. Any tool is good if it's fit for purpose and well handled by the person using it. These points are really difficult to get across, as tool vendors focus too much on features and too little on what actually makes the tool successful when used."
